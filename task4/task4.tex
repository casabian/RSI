\section{Abstract}
This section will give a brief overview to the short paper "Part-based recombination of Characters in SomeRacer" that is going to be written for the course Research Seminar I.

\section{Introduction}
This chapter covers basic terminology to character animation. It also includes a basic overview to the technologies used to achiev motion retargetting and part-based animation.

\subsection{Character animation}
In this chapter a brief introduction to character animation techniques such as key-frame animation and motion capturing

\subsection{Part-based recombination}
Here we adress the need of part-based recombination to achiev the highest possible amount of character setups for the game SomeRacer.

\section{Related Work}
This chapter covers related work in the field of part-based recombination of characters.

\section{Algorithm}
Here we show the algorithm presented by \citep{jain2012exploring} with regard to usage in SomeRacer

\section{Conclusion}
In this section a conclusion  will be presented. We will discuss if part-based recombination is a suitable approach for SomeRacer.
